            <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
                world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't
                know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only
                five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that
                killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

            <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while
                I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this
                case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this
                case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>

            <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that
                show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to
                make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She
                starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>
